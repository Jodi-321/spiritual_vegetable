# Zero Trust MVP - Azure Infrastructure as Code

A production-ready demonstration of Zero Trust security architecture on Microsoft Azure, implementing comprehensive security controls through Infrastructure as Code. This project showcases enterprise-level cloud security design, implementation, and operational practices within a cost-optimized framework.

## Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Zero Trust security principles in a cloud environment, featuring network microsegmentation, identity-based access controls, centralized secret management, and comprehensive monitoring. The architecture eliminates stored credentials, implements defense-in-depth strategies, and provides a scalable foundation for enterprise security requirements.

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Four-tier network segmentation with controlled traffic flows
- Managed identity implementation eliminating credential storage
- Centralized secret management with Azure Key Vault
- Secure administrative access via Azure Bastion

## Security Controls Implemented

### Network Security
- **Microsegmentation**: Four-tier subnet architecture (Public, Private Application, Private Data, Bastion)
- **Traffic Control**: Network Security Groups with default-deny rules
- **Application Segmentation**: Application Security Groups for granular access control
- **Secure Access**: Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH access without public IPs

### Identity and Access Management
- **Zero Stored Credentials**: User-assigned managed identities for all service authentication
- **Least Privilege**: Custom RBAC roles with minimal required permissions
- **Centralized Identity**: Azure Active Directory integration
- **Access Policies**: Key Vault access controls based on managed identities

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All storage encrypted using platform-managed keys
- **Secret Management**: Azure Key Vault for centralized credential storage
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS/TLS enforcement throughout the architecture
- **Key Lifecycle**: Automated key rotation and management

## Technical Architecture

### Network Design
```
Internet → Public Subnet (Foundation for future gateway)
         Private App Subnet (Web/API Servers)
         Private Data Subnet (Data Services + Key Vault)
         
Administrative Access:
Internet → Bastion Subnet (Azure Bastion) → Private App & Data Subnets
```

### Technology Stack
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform with modular design
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure (East US region)
- **Security Framework**: Zero Trust architecture principles
- **Identity Provider**: Azure Active Directory

## Upcoming Enhancements

### Phase 3: Application Gateway & WAF Protection
- **Web Application Firewall**: Application Gateway with OWASP Top 10 protection
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Centralized certificate management and HTTPS enforcement
- **Load Balancing**: High availability across application tier virtual machines
- **External Access Control**: Single secure entry point for web traffic

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Governance
- **Centralized Logging**: Log Analytics workspace for security event collection
- **Security Posture Management**: Azure Security Center integration
- **Policy Enforcement**: Azure Policy assignments for automated compliance
- **Cost Management**: Enhanced budget alerts and advanced resource optimization controls
